The attached Posture and Exposure (P&E) report is the result of a CISA Cyber Assessments service that provides actionable information about public exposures and security posture weaknesses.

All of the findings and information are derived from public information that is currently available. No scanning has occurred for this service.

The report will initially be delivered twice per month, but it will be updated and enhanced to integrate more data sources and be sent with greater frequency in the future. The P&E report is for your situational awareness as a supplement to other threat reports you may have internally or externally. No action is required, but your feedback and questions are more than welcome.

Note: The report is encrypted with your Cyber Hygiene password.

Thank you,

<p>Good afternoon,</p>

<p>Posture and Exposure (P&E) offers stakeholders an opportunity
to view their organizational risk from the viewpoint of the adversary.
We utilize passive reconnaissance services, dark web analysis, and open-source
tools to identify spoofing in order to generate a risk profile report that is
delivered on a regular basis.</p>

<p>As a customer of P&E you are receiving our regularly scheduled report
which contains a summary of the activity we have been tracking on your behalf
for the following services:</p>

<ul>
<li>Domain Masquerading and Monitoring</li>
<li>Credentials Leaked/Exposed</li>
<li>Insecure Devices & Suspected Vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Dark Web Monitoring</li>
<li>Hidden Assets and Risky Services</li>
</ul>

<p>In the attached document you will find a Summary Report with the findings
based on what we identified above. On page 4 of the report, you will
find links to the JSON raw data as it was discovered by us. For the protection of
your organization, we have encrypted the document with the password that was
shared when the agreement was signed for Cyber Hygiene Services. <strong>For
the best results, we recommend using Adobe Acrobat.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, it is important to note that these findings have not been verified;
everything is gathered via passive analysis of publicly available sources.  As
such there may be false positive findings, however these findings should be
treated as information that your organization is leaking out to the internet
for adversaries to notice.</p>
